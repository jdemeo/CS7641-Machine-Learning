Supervised Learning Assignment
HIV-1 Protease Cleavage and Gamma Particle Classification

----------------------------------------

Files needed to run python code:
- HIV-1 Dataset:
        - Models_HIV1.ipynb
        - hiv1_1.csv
        - hiv1_2.csv
- Gamma Dataset:        
        - Models_Gamma.ipynb
        - gamma.csv

# RUNNING THE NOTEBOOKS


Each notebook is broken up into:
        - Preprocessing of the dataset
        - Cross Validation:
                - Learning Curve: acquiring data for learning curve plots
                - Model Complexity: testing of hyper parameters to find optimal hyperparameter
                - Time Complexity: testing of runtimes for each algorithm
        - Final Model Builds: final testing of the optimized algorithms


The notebooks are commented appropriately to explain what each script does. ‘MODEL BUILD HERE’ indicates where each algorithm should be instantiated. The scripts to do not automatically loop through every possible test I performed, but does indicate where variables should be changed especially with hyperparameter optimization scripts.
