# CS 7641 - Machine Learning

- Repository for scripts related to assignments completed for CS 7461 Machine Learning course
- **Assignment 1**: Applied various classification models to the GAMMA (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/MAGIC+Gamma+Telescope) and HIV 1 (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/HIV-1+protease+cleavage) datasets to build an understanding of how the algorithms perform and behave given different types of data.
- **Assignment 2**: Implementation and application of various random search algorithms (randomized hill climbing, simulated annealing, genetic algorithm, MIMIC) to optiimze the weights for neural networks developed in assignment 1.
- **Assignment 3**: Applications of unsupervised methods (k-means, Expectation Maximization) and dimensionality reduction algorithsm (PCA, ICA, Randomized Projections) to analyze the pros and cons of such to classifications tasks from assignment 1.
- **Assignment 4**: Build toy problems to explore Markov Decision Processes and Reinforcement Learning.
